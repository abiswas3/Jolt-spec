This page contains links to documentation created to aid efforts at formally verifying the [Jolt zk-VM](https://github.com/a16z/jolt).
The [Jolt Walkthrough](@/jolt-walkthrough/_index.md) assumes no SNARK or zk-VM background, and guides the reader through the steps of verifying the execution of a guest program. 
The [Jolt Specifications](@/references/_index.md) aim to act as a complete reference to specific components within Jolt.
See the [Overview](@/jolt-walkthrough/0_overview.md) section for a brief description of the logical components of Jolt.
The specifications are often autogenerated from the actual code base, with minor human supervision. 
Sometimes agentic tools are also used to diff the actual code base and existing documentation to look for inconsistencies.
